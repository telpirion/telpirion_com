        Welcome to the professional and personal website for me, Eric M. Schmidt. Hi!
    </p>
    <p>
        Check out the JavaScript and HTML5 video games published on the site.
        I programmed all of the video games myself (excluding external libraries).
        Some art in the games was donated by friends.

        I built this website using
        <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>. Right now, I have the site hosted using
        <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google AppEngine on Google Cloud</a>.
