    <h2>Software Development</h2>
    <p>
        Check out the JavaScript and HTML5 video games <a href="/games">published
        on the site</a>.
        I programmed all of the video games myself (excluding external libraries).
        Some art in the games was donated by friends.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have also released apps to the Google Play Store and the Windows
        Store. You can see a list of my apps on the <a href="/apps">Apps page</a>.
    <p>
        I built this website using
        <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular<mat-icon>launch</mat-icon></a>.
        I have the site hosted using

    <h2>Technical Writing</h2>
    <p>
        I currently work full-time at Google as a technical writer. I write
        the documentation for the
        <span *ngFor="let doc of docSets; index as i">
        <span *ngIf="i == (docSets.length - 1)"> and </span>
        <a href="{{doc.url}}" target="_blank">{{doc.title}}
            <mat-icon>launch</mat-icon></a>
        <span *ngIf="i != (docSets.length - 1)">, </span> </span> services.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have also published several articles to a trade publication,
        MSDN Magazine. You can see a list of my published works
        <a href="/publications">here</a>.
