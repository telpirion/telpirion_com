## About

In 2013, I started working as a Programmer-Writer on the Windows SDK team in
the Operating Systems division in Microsoft. The Windows 8.1 release was on
the horizon and the [JavaScript API for Windows (aka "WinJS")][js-api] needed
documentation. I joined the team specifically to assist writing the Windows 8.1
documentation for WinJS. As I started the gig, I realized that I needed to build 
my own app to understand the API surface in a credible way.

The question was: what kind of app to create?

One day I was riding on the bus to work, trying to brush up on my Latin
reading skills. The bus bounced and jounced down the freeway, sending my book
and dictionary all over the place. I thought to myself, "If only I had an app
that allowed me to read my source work, look up words in the dictionary, AND
view an English translation of the work."

Thus, the concept for the Latin Reader was born.
