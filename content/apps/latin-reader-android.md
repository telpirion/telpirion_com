and English. You can read Caesar's Gallic Wars, Virgil's Aeneid, Ovid's
Metamorphosis, Petronius, Lucretius, and others on your phone or tablet. The
Latin Reader app includes a complete Latin to English dictionary with over 
17,000 entries.

## About

In 2016, I started work at Google as a developer documentation writer for
the Android Frameworks. For my start project, I decided to port my Latin
Readers app from Windows to Android. This project gave me the opportunity to
learn the Android API surface while also familiarizing myself with the Android
developer experience.

Over the past 14 releases, I have gradually added features to the Latin Reader.
I've added Kotlin code, improved the search experience, reduced the footprint of
the app, and streamlined the navigation.
