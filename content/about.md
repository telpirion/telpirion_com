Here's where I share my portfolio, including my blog posts, apps, projects, and
even some silly JavaScript games. I currently work at Google, where I build
sample applications and maintain code snippets for Google Cloud customers. I
have a wide range of interests in technology; I tend to focus most on AI/ML,
databases, data analytics, and data pipelines. All opinions expressed are mine.

When not working, I prefer to spend time with my family. I can also be found
playing music, playing video games, or building LEGO kits. I live in the
beautiful Pacific Northwest, so I try to get out to camp and hike whenever
I can.

## Why "Telpirion"?

Well, I'm a big fan of the works of [J.R.R. Tolkien][tolkien], especially
his magnum opus, [The Silmarillion][silmarillion]. Among the many references 
in _The Silmarillion_ is a silver tree, ["Telperion"][telperion]. I wanted to
pay homage to my favorite author, hence the user name `Telpirion`. (Yes, I know
it is misspelled.)

**Note**: ["Telperion" is copyright â’¸ by the Tolkien Estate][tolkien-estate].

## About the apps

My most recent release is [My Herodotus][my-herodotus],
an AI-powered web application. The web app acts as a travel agent to help you
plan a trip. 

**Note:** You must log in with a Google account to access the My Herodotus app. 
It costs money to host so I want to ensure only serious users are using it.

I have also published a couple of apps on the Google Play Store and the Windows
Store. The [Latin Reader app for Android][latin-reader-android] and
[Latin Reader app for Windows 8, 8.1, and 10][latin-reader-windows]
allow readers to enjoy several classics in their original Latin source. With
these apps, readers can flip between the Latin source and English translation of
each classical work. The apps also include an integrated
dictionary, word-of-the-day feature (Windows only), and
marginalia note-taking (Windows only).

You can read more about each of the apps on the [Apps page](/apps).
