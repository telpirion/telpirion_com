## About

The game is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game. You control
a "snake" as it moves around the canvas. The goal is to eat the red "food"
blocks that appear. Each time you eat a food block, your snake grows longer. If
your snake runs into the edge of the canvas or runs into itself, the game is
over.

This game came about as a part of
[Google's Computer Science Summer Institute][cssi]. This game was featured as
one of the final lessons in the curriculum. I built this game while learning
how to teach the curriculum.

## How to play

+ Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to move your snake.
+ If your snake goes off the screen, your game is over.
+ To restart the game, refresh your browser.

## Known bugs

+ There is no restart or pause feature. As mentioned above, you must refresh
  your browser to restart the game.
