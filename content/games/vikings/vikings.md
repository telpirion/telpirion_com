Vikings!!! is a simple platformer. It uses a physics engine of my own design
and code.

## About

In the Vikings!!! game, you control a viking warrior who must navigate a
dangerous landscape filled with obstacles. You must jump over the obstacles
in order to reach the end of the level. Each level is timed, so you can
try to beat your best time.

I created Vikings!!! in 2014 while learning how to write JavaScript. I was
inspired by the book,
[HTML5 Games: Creating Games with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL][html5games]. This
game represents my first attempt at creating my own video game using JavaScript.
I wanted to learn how to build a physics and animation engine ... so I did!
The current artwork was donated by various artists of my acquaintance. The game
features simple controls and challenging levels.
