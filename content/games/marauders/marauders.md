## About

The Space Marauders game is a simple, retro-style arcade game built using P5.js.
It's inspired by classic space shooters like Space Invaders. Players control a
spaceship and must defend against waves of descending alien invaders. The goal
is to shoot down all the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen or
destroy the player's ship.

This game came about as a part of
[Google's Computer Science Summer Institute][cssi]. I built this game to show
the CSSI students what they could potentially accomplish with the skills we
taught them and the P5.js library.

## How to play

+ Use the left and right arrow keys to move your spaceship.
+ Use the spacebar to shoot bullets at the marauders.
+ To restart the game, refresh your browser.

## Known issues

+ The spaceship continues to move in a single direction even after the key is
  released. To change direction, you must press the opposite arrow key.
+ There is no restart or pause feature. As mentioned above, you must refresh
  your browser to restart the game.
